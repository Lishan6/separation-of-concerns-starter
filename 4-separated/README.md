# Separated

Full-separated projects to study:

0. Practice using the debugger to step through a separated project.
1. Simple, single-interaction web pages.
2. Projects with multiple user interactions.
3. Sites that use event bubbling.
4. Web pages with DOM component functions.
5. Web pages that use events & listeners in more advanced ways, including custom events.

And of course, projects later in the list may have all of the features.
