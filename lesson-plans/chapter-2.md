## After Class

Work on the exercises in this repository, and continue studying your favorite tutorial(s).

Meet with your group and begin planning + developing your **A List** deliverable.

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain
what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is
a great way to learn.
