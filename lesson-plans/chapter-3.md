Review the _components_ role and study examples from `/separated` that use components.

## After Class

Work on the exercises in this repo, and continue studying your favorite tutorial(s).

Study together! Working in small groups and taking turns to predict and explain
what is happening with the code is a nice way to spend a few hours. Teaching is
a great way to learn.
